# Fact-checking Outputs from ChatGPT

### Goals:
The primary goal with this assignment is to give you hands-on experience analyzing outputs from
large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. You will understand what sorts of non-factual outputs LLMs
can generate, and what is involved in the process of verifying those outputs against Wikipedia. In addition,
you will conduct some error analysis of the mistakes your fact-checking model makes.

### To run:
Ensure all required packages and libraries are installed before executing the following commands:  
`python factchecking_main.py --mode word_overlap`  
`python factchecking_main.py --mode entailment`
